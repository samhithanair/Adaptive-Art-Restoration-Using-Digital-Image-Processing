#  Adaptive Art Restoration Using Digital Image Processing

This project implements a comprehensive image restoration pipeline designed to enhance low-quality images by applying various restoration techniques based on the characteristics of the input image.

# Features
1. Gamma Correction: Adjusts image brightness based on gamma values.
2. Contrast Stretching: Enhances image contrast by stretching intensity values.
3. Dehazing: Removes haze using dark channel prior and atmospheric light estimation.
4. Noise Reduction: Reduces noise using Gaussian blur.
5. Sharpening: Enhances image edges for improved clarity.
6. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Calculation: Dynamically determines the need for noise reduction.
7. Adaptive Restoration: Automatically applies restoration techniques based on image brightness, contrast, and noise levels.
